/*
Write a function that always returns 5

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/

Good luck :)

//My solution
//#1
function unusualFive() {
  const arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"];
  return arr.indexOf("f");
}

//#2
function unusualFive() {
  return "Allah".length;
}
